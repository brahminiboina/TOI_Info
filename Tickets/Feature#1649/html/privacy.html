<br/>
<br/><b>PROTECTING YOUR INFORMATION</b>
<br/>
<br/>We follow generally accepted industry security standards to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your personal information. However, no commercial method of information transfer over the Internet or electronic data storage is known to be 100% secure. As a result, WIPLAY cannot guarantee the absolute security of that information during its transmission or its storage in our systems. Be advised that if you send messages or post material containing personal information, that information may be collected and used by others.
<br/>
<br/>Upon termination of your account, we will remove your profile and other personal information from view. We, however, may (but are not obligated to) keep information about you that is on our system following your termination. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of personal data or content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or if other users have copied or stored your personal data or content.
<br/>
<br/><b>YOUR OPTIONS</b>
<br/>
<br/>1.	COST FREE INFORMATION
<br/>
<br/>The right to cost-free information about the personal data stored in regard to your person. Furthermore, you have a right, subject to the statutory provisions, to have such personal data corrected, blocked, and deleted. We may, however, decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.

<br/><b>MISCELLANEOUS</b>
<br/>
<br/>1.	EXTERNAL WEBSITES / THIRD-PARTY LINKS / ADVERTISERS 
<br/>
<br/>We may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These third parties may use cookies, pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear gifs), and other technologies to collect information for such purposes. Pixel tags enable recognizing a browser's cookie when a browser visits the site on which the beacon is located, and to learn which banner ads bring users to a given site. Similarly, ads appearing on any of our Services may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. 
<br/>
<br/>This Policy covers the use of cookies by WIPLAY and does not cover the use of cookies by any third-parties. We have no control over the privacy practices or the content of any of our business partners, advertisers, sponsors, or other websites to which we provide links.

Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our Services and welcome any feedback about these sites.
<br/>
<br/>2.	CHILDREN'S ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT ("COPPA") 
<br/>
<br/>We desire and strive to comply with the requirements of the COPPA, which was established to protect children's online privacy. COPPA requires that operators of online services (such as ours) adhere to specific guidelines regarding the collection and handling of personal information about children under the age of 13. 
<br/>
<br/>WIPLAY is not directed at children and does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register or participate in our Services. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for our Services or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to WIPLAY. In the event that we learn through reliable source , over phone or an email, that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, then we will take all reasonable measures to delete that information as quickly as possible and to not use such information for any purpose (except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or others as required or allowed by law). 
<br/>
<br/>We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's internet usage and to help enforce our Policy by instructing their children to never provide personal information to the operators of online services. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us without such parental consent, please write to us or contact us over telephone. 
<br/>
<br/>3.	BUSINESS TRANSFERS 
<br/>
<br/>If WIPLAY, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of WIPLAY may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this Policy.

<br/>4.	AGGREGATED STATISTICS 
<br/>
<br/>WIPLAY may collect statistics about the behavior of users to its Services. When in the aggregate form and not pointing to a particular individual, we may display this information publicly or provide it to others.

<br/>
<br/>This Policy and the relationship between WIPLAY and you hereto shall be governed by, and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of India without having regard to the conflict of law's provisions thereunder. The courts of Hyderabad, India, shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all matters arising pursuant to this Policy.
